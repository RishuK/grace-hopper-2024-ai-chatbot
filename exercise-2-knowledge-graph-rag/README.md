# Excercise execution

## RAG Chatbot with Langchain, LLM, and knowledge graph

We will build a RAG chatbot - this time we will add a knowledge graph to enable a more intelligent chatbot, which can answer more complex user questions.

## Architecture

<div> 
    <img src="./assets/example2-diagram.png" width="50%"/>
</div>
<br/>

**Steps:**

### Step 1: Initialize Neo4j

- Install Neo4j Desktop using above installation steps and replace the password value in code.

- Create Neo4j database wrapper for performing the graph operations.
  [About Neo4jGraph](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/graphs/langchain_community.graphs.neo4j_graph.Neo4jGraph.html)

```
    graph = Neo4jGraph()
```

### Step 2: Convert textual documents into graph-based documents using LLMGraphTransformer

- Create an instance of LLMGraphTransformer, it converts textual documents into graph-based documents using LLM.
  [About LLMGraphTransformer](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/graph_transformers/langchain_experimental.graph_transformers.llm.LLMGraphTransformer.html)

  It includes passing below parameters:

  - llm: Pass the Llama3 instance running using Ollama
  - allowed_nodes: Specifies which node types are allowed in the graph. Defaults to an empty list, allowing all node types.
  - allowed_relationships: Specifies which relationship types are allowed in the graph. Defaults to an empty list, allowing all relationship types.

```
    llm_transformer = LLMGraphTransformer(
        llm=llm,
        allowed_nodes=["Company", "Person", "Product", "Supplier", "Warehouse", "Store", "Shipment", "Customer", "External Factor", "Supply Chain", "Location", "Weather Condition", "Holiday", "Region", "Sales Trend"],
        allowed_relationships=["WORKS_FOR", "CREATES", "SUPPLIES", "STOCKS", "DELIVERS_TO", "LOCATED_AT", "AFFECTED_BY", "AFFECTS", "MANAGES", "CONTAINS", "HAS_CONTRACT_WITH", "HAS_INVENTORY", "INFLUENCES" ],
    )
```

- Extract graph data by converting a sequence of documents into graph documents.
  [About LLMGraphTransformer.convert_to_graph_documents()](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/graph_transformers/langchain_experimental.graph_transformers.llm.LLMGraphTransformer.html#langchain_experimental.graph_transformers.llm.LLMGraphTransformer.convert_to_graph_documents)

```
   graph_documents = llm_transformer.convert_to_graph_documents(documents)
   print("graph documents", graph_documents)
```

### Step-3: Store to neo4j

- Store to neo4j using add_graph_documents(), this method constructs nodes and relationships in the graph based on the provided GraphDocument objects.
  [About Neo4jGraph add_graph_documents()](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/graphs/langchain_community.graphs.neo4j_graph.Neo4jGraph.html#langchain_community.graphs.neo4j_graph.Neo4jGraph.add_graph_documents)

```
   graph.add_graph_documents(
      graph_documents,
      baseEntityLabel=True,
      include_source=True
   )
   print("Documents successfully added to Graph DataBase")
```

### Step-4: Initialize and return a Neo4jVector instance from existing graph using OllamaEmbeddings

- Instantiate the Ollama embedding model and generate embeddings using the locally running LLaMA3.1-8b
  [About OllamaEmbeddings](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/ollama/embeddings/langchain_ollama.embeddings.OllamaEmbeddings.html)

```
    local_embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model="llama3.1:8b")
```

- Initialize and return a Neo4jVector instance from existing graph. This method initializes and returns a Neo4jVector instance using the provided parameters and the existing graph. It validates the existence of the indices and creates new ones if they donâ€™t exist.
  [About Neo4jVector.from_existing_graph()](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/vectorstores/langchain_community.vectorstores.neo4j_vector.Neo4jVector.html#langchain_community.vectorstores.neo4j_vector.Neo4jVector.from_existing_graph)

```
   vector_index = Neo4jVector.from_existing_graph(
      embedding=local_embeddings,
      search_type="hybrid",
      node_label="Document",
      text_node_properties=["text"],
      embedding_node_property="embedding"
   )
```

### Step-5: Create a RetrievalQA chain for question-answering

- Create custom prompt template. A prompt template consists of a string template, it can contain the system prompt, human question and context.

```
   template = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
   If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.
   Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer as concise as possible.
   Always say "thanks for asking!" at the end of the answer.
   {context}
   Question: {question}
   Helpful Answer:"""
```

- Create a PromptTemplate instance with the custom prompt template for the language model.
  [About PromptTemplate](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.prompt.PromptTemplate.html)

```
   QA_CHAIN_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["context", "question"], template=template)
```

- Create a RetrievalQA Chain for question-answering against an index using the Neo4jVector as the retriever.
  [About RetrievalQA](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.retrieval_qa.base.RetrievalQA.html#)

```
   qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
      llm,
      retriever=vector_index.as_retriever(),
      chain_type_kwargs={"prompt": QA_CHAIN_PROMPT}
   )
```

### Step-6: Execute the Exercise-2 code

Run the below command to execute the exercise-2 code.

```
    python3 knowledge-graph-rag.py
```
